      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        When approaching the problem of solving the "Banana Collector" environment, I relied heavily on the 
        knowledge and intuition gained from earlier chapters from the course, ranging back to Markov Decision Processes
        and Temporal Difference learning, but especielly the material on DQN.

        I decided to adapt the implementation of the algorithm used to solve the "Lunar Lander" environment.
      </p>

      A link to the original paper on DQN can be found <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf">here</a>.

      <h2>Obstacles & Future improvements</h2>
      <p>
        In order to submit the project before the recommended deadline, I had to allocate my time carefully.
        I decided to focus on gaining a solid understanding of the main components of the DQN algorithm,
        as a result I was unable to add certain improvements to the basic implementation of DQN,
        such as Dueling DQN and Prioritized Experience Replay. 
        The next step would involve modifying the algorithm with the aforementioned techniques.

        I would also like to experiment with the neural network architecture by changing the number
        of layers and neurons, and inspect how it would affect the output.
        
        Lastly, it is my goal to learn more about Pytorch and its syntax. I am quite new to the framework, and
        I would greatly benefit from spending some more time with the documentation.
