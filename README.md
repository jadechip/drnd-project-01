# Project 1: Navigation

:banana: :banana: :banana: :banana: :banana :banana: :banana: :banana: :banana: :banana

### Introduction

The goal of the project is to train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

## Setup

1. Optionally create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv drlnd
```

2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Jupyter server

```
jupyter notebook
```
